# Syntax-Highlighting-Editor_Programming-project

## 📄 Description

**Syntax-Highlighting-Editor** is a lightweight text editor with syntax highlighting capabilities, built for specific programming languages. The editor aims to enhance the coding experience by visually distinguishing code elements like keywords, variables, and strings through color-coded highlights. This allows users to write, read, and debug code more efficiently.

The editor is written in Python, leveraging lexing and parsing techniques to analyze the code structure and apply syntax rules for highlighting. This project focuses on delivering a balance between simplicity, performance, and user customization.
